# Introduction
This is a plugin which sets the title of uploaded images to an empty string 
instead of injecting the filename.

Often the filename is not optimised. It can leak out in the form of gallery 
captions or alt/title tags and look messy.

This plug defaults your image uploads to an empty string, so you can be sure
if a caption is going to be displayed, that it is one you have set yourself.

# Usage
Install the plugin and activate it.

The next image you upload will have an empty title tag once it appears in the
media library.

Note: This doesn't currently apply to existing images in the media library,
only new uploads. Visit the github repo and open an issue if you would find
this kind of feature useful.
